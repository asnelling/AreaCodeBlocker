# Prefix Screener

## Usage

To add a prefix to the blocklist, press "+" on the bottom right:

![Add a new prefix](screenshots/empty_blocklist.png)

Enter a prefix, including country code. The app will screen incoming calls from numbers that begin with this prefix.

![Choose screen action](screenshots/new_prefix.png)

Choose an action to take for incoming calls matching the newly entered prefix:

1. **Block:** Disallow the call. The caller will continue to hear a ringing
tone until the call goes to voicemail.

2. **Reject:** Reject the call as if done manually by the user, immediately
sending the caller to voicemail.

3. **Silence:** Allow the call, but silence the ringer. The user will be
visually notified of the incoming call.
